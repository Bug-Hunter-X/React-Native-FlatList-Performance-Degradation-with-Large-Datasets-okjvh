In React Native, when using FlatList with a large dataset, I encountered an issue where the component would render slowly and become unresponsive.  This was particularly noticeable when scrolling quickly or when the data was updated frequently. The initial render time was acceptable, but subsequent renders became very sluggish.  I tried optimizing the render methods but the performance didn't improve significantly. The component was also failing to properly update when the data changed, leading to inconsistent display of information.
